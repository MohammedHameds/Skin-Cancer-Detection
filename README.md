# Skin-Cancer-Classification-Using-CNN-Deep-Learning-Algorithm

# Overview
As skin cancer is one of the most frequent cancers globally, accurate, non-invasive dermoscopy-based diagnosis becomes essential and promising. A task of Easy Company’s Deep Learning CNN model is to predict seven disease classes with skin lesion images, including melanoma (MEL), melanocytic nevus (NV), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), actinic keratosis / Bowens disease (intraepithelial carcinoma) (AKIEC), benign keratosis (solar lentigo / seborrheic keratosis / lichen planus-like keratosis) (BKL), dermatoﬁbroma (DF) and vascular lesion (VASC) as deﬁned by the International Dermatology Society.

# DATASET
This the HAM10000 ("Human against machine with 10000 training images") dataset. It consists of 10015 dermatoscopy 
images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through 
the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts.

# TYPES OF SKIN CANCER
It has 7 different classes of skin lesion which are listed below:
1. Melanocytic Nevi (NV)
2. Melanoma (MEL)
3. Benign Keratosis-like Lesion (BKL)
4. Dermatofibroma (DF)
5. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
6. Actinic Keratoses (Akiec)
7. Vascular Lesions (Vasc)

Melanocytic nevi, keratosis, vascular and dermatofibroma are benign lesions
Melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis are malignant lesions


# SOCIETAL GOOD
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers that has been increasing world wide. Due to diverse characteristics in benign lesions and specific lesions seen from diseases, distinguishing fatal skin cancer from other skin disorders (with the potential of cancer) is VERY IMPORTANT.
Finding out the type of cancer can take months for doctors as it is a very tedious practice and also requires the use of expensive devices and contraptions. This would waste a good lot of time for the patient which could have been utilized by the doctors to treat the patient in time. It is also monetarily very demanding on the patient’s part, which could pose a problem if the patient is not financially settled.
Our Deep learning CNN model has been trained with 10015 pre-determined skin cancer type images to accurately predict what type of cancer (or skin disease) the given patient is facing. 

# BUSINESS MODEL
Integrating this Deep Learning model into an android app or some website or web utility, we can sell this to various medical institutions treating cancer at a large scale.
A minimal level of clerical knowledge and experience will then be sufficient for anyone to easily run our integrated model on any server/ device available in various hospitals. This can shorten the time taken to determine the type of skin disease drastically, saving days of diagnosis and also putting less hamper financially.

# CONCLUSION
A cancer patient goes through a lot and we as a society must be there for them in such dire situations. If we can save them the time they need to decide and plan their future by drastically reducing the time taken to detect their type of cancer at an early stage, we are bringing them one step closer to a happier life. Happiness is key when going through such an emotional run. Detecting the type of cancer at an early stage makes sure we can treat them if not cure them. This is crucial to medical institutions all around the globe if they want to make sure they can successfully treat the cancer patient.
